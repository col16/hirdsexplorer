NIWA's High Intensity Rainfall Design System (HIRDS) provides estimates of high intensity rainfall at across New Zealand for a range of return periods and event durations. The primary web interface is at [hirds.niwa.co.nz](https://hirds.niwa.co.nz/). For a detailed description of the underlying model, refer to the [HIRDSv4 Technical Report](https://niwa.co.nz/sites/niwa.co.nz/files/2018022CH_HIRDSv4_Final.pdf) (Trevor Carey-Smith et al, 2018).

This repository is the code for the HIRDS Explorer website, [https://hirdsexplorer.nz](https://hirdsexplorer.nz). It is written in React and uses a Leaflet map. It was developed by [Cameron Oliver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-oliver-46a640b6/), a flood modeller based in Christchurch. Data is taken from the 2 km resolution dataset [available online](https://data-niwa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/edcbe0a99d7f4df59501ba55973648f5).
